          <div class="abouttext">
            <h2>Initiative</h2>
            <p>Autism Teenage Partnership (ATP) is an initiative dedicated to providing accessible, free, and safe spaces for teens diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the Toronto (ATP-TO) and Kitchener-Waterloo (ATP-KW) regions. We support individuals with ASD by delivering weekly social programming that enables them to express themselves through games, crafts, and team-building activities. </p>
            <p>ATP-TO currently runs every Wednesday nights from 6pm to 8pm at Milliken Park Community Recreation Centre, located at the south-east corner of McCowan Road and Steeles Avenue E. </p>
            <p>Our newest chapter, ATP-KW is scheduled to launch on Saturday June 6th and will continue every Saturdays from 7pm to 9pm. Location is TBA.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Autism Awareness initiative was started as a university club at Western University by Janson Chan and Brandon Wildfong. The club became known as Autism Awareness at Western (AAW) and continues to run today with over 120 members raising awareness of ASD.</p>
            <p>When Janson returned to the GTA to study at YorkU, he became involved with the Agent's of Change Program allowing him to establish Autism Awareness at York (AAY). AAY was launched as Autism Teenage Partnership in the summer of 2014 and has helped over 25 participants in the local GTA and neighbouring Markham area. </p>
            <p>Our program continues to grow with widespread success and continued support for teens with ASD and their families. More recently, we are happy to announce ATP's expansion into the Kitchener-Waterloo region spearheaded by Denise Dye.</p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Autism Teenage Partnership aims to positively impact the lives of individuals diagnosed with autism and their families through:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fostering the development of social skills and friendships to enhance quality of life and form social support networks. </li>
              <li>Allow for easy integration into society through the creation of inclusive and safe environments. </li>
              <li>Work with local agencies to develop relationships and raise awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorders.</li>
              <li>Develop toolkits for others to initiate ATP Chapters in underserved regions in Ontario.</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Toronto</h2>
                <p>Toronto is the home of Autism Teenage Partnershipâ€™s original chapter.  We currently operate from Milliken Park Community Recreation Centre every Wednesday nights from 6pm to 8pm.</p>
                <p>We recognize teens with ASD often suffer from social deficits, thus we bring together teens aged 14-25 years in a safe space to encourage friendships, practice social skills and connect over shared interests. ATP-TO has welcomed a variety of participants from the low-functioning to the high-functioning end of the spectrum and have tailored our program to meet the unique needs of each individual. Our free, social programming involves a variety of activities such as discussion circles, charades, board games, outdoor sporting activities, nature walks, and theme nights such as video game and movie nights!</p>
                <p>Aside from our weekly programs, we are also invited to numerous speaking engagements to advocate for individuals with autism and raise awareness of ASD to reduce the associated stigma.</p>
                <p>If interested in signing your teen up for our program, please click on the Register now link below to complete the online registration form. Scroll further for more information and to connect with us!</p>

                <p>Autism Teenage Partnership is now in Kitchener-Waterloo! And the first teen get-together is Saturday, June 6th!</p>
                <p>ATP-KW brings together teens (14 years old and up) wanting to meet peers who are also Aspergers or High Functioning. Outings and activities are chosen by participants, and every night is supported by trained university volunteers.   This teen night helps to build confidence and independence, and provides members with a sense of belonging. Engaging in a social group creates many new opportunities for individuals to make friends, share meaningful experiences, mutual interests, and challenges in their daily lives; here they can feel welcome just being themselves.</p>
                <p>The teens get together year-round, every Saturday night from 7-9pm. Weeks will alternate with hanging out at the club and going out on the town!   Activities may include: </p>
                  <ul>
